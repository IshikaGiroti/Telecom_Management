# Telecom_Management

This project aims to helps the admin monitor all the telecom records in an organised and systematic manner. It prevents the admin from going old school, i.e, managing all the records in the record books and instead, administering all the records virtually in an easy manner. Since the Volume of data is huge, we need a system which has accuracy, speed and transparency.

Here, we can add, modify/update  and delete the customerâ€™s records based on phone number. The project can also help in processing the payment, listing and searching the current records.
